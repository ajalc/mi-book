# Final presentations

**This is it**!
After three weeks of intense focus on MI, you're ready to showcase what you've learned in your self-directed research projects.
We'll be starting final presentations on Zoom at **2:00PM PDT** and you're welcome to invite family and friends to this event! üôå

Before then, please [edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/enze-chen/mi-book/blob/master/week_3/14/final_presentations.md) to add everything in square brackets: 

- Your emoji ([Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/))
- Presentation title
- Description
- A relevant figure that you created

Detailed instructions for how to do this can be found in Tuesday's mini-lesson on {doc}`../12/pull_requests`.

The following presenters are ordered alphabetically by first name.

To our guests: Check out the cool projects these students have made! üòé

**Description**: There is a growing demand for new high-k dielectric materials, which are instrumental to the functionality and miniaturization of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors. Of the thousands of materials and properties stored in the Materials Project database, only a subset contains information about the dielectric constants. We are able to design data-driven prediction models using supervised machine learning methods and cross-validation to estimate the dielectric constants for the remaining materials. By using a random forest regression model‚Äîpresenting 39% relative error‚Äîwe identify nearly 30 compounds that were not previously studied for this application, each with bandgaps in the insulator/dielectric range, a formation energy greater than the current industry standard SiO2, and large k values.  Further modeling and cost analysis will allow us to narrow our list of candidate materials.

**Description**: Moore‚Äôs Law is the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years. In order to keep up with this law, scientists and engineers have been searching for the next dielectric materials that will continue to push this law forward. Using data acquired from the Materials Project database, we were able to predict the electronic dielectric component for materials which had not yet been analyzed before via Density Functional Theory by using machine learning. The model used was a random forest regression and it was trained using materials who‚Äôs electronic contribution to the dielectric was already compiled using DFT. Although actual scientific experimentation is needed to verify the results, the model seems to have successfully predicted a new list of promising materials which may usher in a new golden age of technology.
